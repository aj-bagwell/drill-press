A simple, cross platform crate for finding the locations of holes in sparse files.

Forked from Nathan McCarty's [hole_punch](https://docs.rs/hole-punch) ([git](https://gitlab.com/asuran-rs/hole-punch))

Currently supports Unix-like platforms that support the `SEEK_HOLE` and `SEEK_DATA` commands on `lseek`, as well as windows.

The operating systems that currently support filesystem-level sparsity information are:

1.	Linux
2.	Android
3.	FreeBSD
4.	Windows
5.  MacOS

These are currently implemented with a compile time switch, and `SparseFile::scan_chunks` will always immediately return with a `ScanError::UnsupportedPlatform` error on platforms not on this list.

Usage
-----

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use drill_press::*;

let mut file = File::open("a big sparse file");
let segments = file.scan_chunks().expect("Unable to scan chunks");
for segment in segments {
    if SegmentType::Data == segment.segment_type {
        let start = segment.start();
        let length = segment.len();
        do_something_with_data(&mut file, start, length);
    }
}
```
